# 💼 Project Overview

This project analyzes house pricing data in King County, WA, and builds a predictive model using **Linear Regression**. It involves thorough preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation using industry-standard metrics.

---

## 🧠 Key Steps Implemented

- ✅ Loaded data from a structured CSV file  
- ✅ Selected relevant columns for prediction  
- ✅ Extracted **year** and **month** from the date field  
- ✅ Removed redundant/unnecessary features  
- ✅ Encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`  
- ✅ Scaled numerical data with `StandardScaler`  
- ✅ Performed **train-test split** for model validation  
- ✅ Built a **Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`  
- ✅ Evaluated model performance using **R² Score** and **RMSE**

## 📈 Results

The model provides a strong baseline for predicting house prices in the region. Further improvements can be made by:

- Adding feature interactions  
- Trying non-linear models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest)  
- Hyperparameter tuning
